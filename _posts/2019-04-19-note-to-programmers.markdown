## Hey Programmers! <br><br>

I’m writing this simple note to those who is getting started in the field of programming or coding, because it was inevitable for me to write this note, as we know there especially at this information interchangeable age there are many students who take their admissions in computer science sector, and at that institution, it is must to teach them some kind of algorithms, data structures with some coding languages. Most of the time it’d be their first time interaction with specific programming languages, but some kids have prior experience to see how codes look like, but for sake of their eyes, they never take the risk to get their hands dirty in coding. Well, that’s the most common dilemma of computer science students. 
So where was, I; I was about to say what they do afterward and they do the most common thing after taking the degree of engineers, they took some certain courses either online or offline, today bizarre amount of institutes run online, they teach their kids online by some practicing method or repetition method, their kids repeat what their teachers did in that lecture. My actual concern is, the doubling amount of programmers. Who just got started. Who just got stuck at single place, and their hesitation stops them to solve as much as problem it required to be a good programmer.

The definition of a programmer is or should be Problem Solver, no matter what they did, which institution they attend, but their mind should be in the direction of problem-solving. 

I don’t have any problems to good institutions who is shipping decent programmers, but I have concern to those coders, those students who is getting into the field of computing, computer is itself a machine made for problem-solving, so their back end people should have problem-solving mentality, shape a better path for a better destination. Today, anyone can learn coding and be a programmer, so respect that, learn not only for gaining degrees, instead of being a better person, solve at least a single problem in life, help at least a single person for getting them their goal. Make something great, re-innovate a piece of code, make something better, keep your enthusiasms always on, switch to learning attitude behalf of knowing attitude.
