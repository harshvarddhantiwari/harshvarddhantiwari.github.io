## A Stagnant Motivation Everywhere

We’re all using any sort of social media, anyway everyday. And at every single on we would have liked or followed any kinda motivational or so called success saying page or group where we get bizarre amount of motivational quotes daily, or even whenever we fetch page. 

What does that mean?

How far our lives changed? Do we remembered any of ‘em? And one last question; Do we really need this pinnacle motivation if it charge us like energy drink, temporarily. 
I know some of you would disagree from my sayin, but really I know that in this unsettle and disappointed world we need some motivation and why have I problem with this? My point here is how productive you become by reading all this? Have you ever think a decade ago people were rely on some sort of motivational quotes which were stated by scientists like Einstein, Edison or Ford. Or they would rather get motivation by reading self-help book, but never rely on some psychotic ordinary saying quotes, which is completely relatable and time consuming. Take this like, when you open your social media, like Facebook, Instagram or whats app, you get bombarded by some human relatable so called motivation quotes, which for some time tends you to think about you, that this piece of sentence is right, and it makes us inferior in many ways, we thought ourselves that we need to change ourselves, we are stupid or we are unsuccessful in many ways, and that’s not right, we never accept ourselves as a truth and tend to change every single time by listening external sources. There are people who is so called successful not by subscribing motivational pages, but by not being status quo. They were relentless about their dream, they were visionary they dedicated their entire life with one single obsession about their believe, which then prove last.


All I am saying is, look yourself as a person who is complete and don’t need to change, instead we can improve ourselves like most application improve its version itself. Upgrade for better don’t listen blindly all those quotes, I admit they are true and make sense but there is a quote which I wanna to state lastly;

“How many success stories you need, to make your own.” 

Anyway it’s my opinion, feel free to leave comment on this below, what do you think about it?
Or you can read this blog in whatever language you prefer.
Thanks for reading this.
