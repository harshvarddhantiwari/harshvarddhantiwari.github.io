Hi, :wave: <br><br>
Hi this is harsh, doing my masters in computer applications from Kiit university, Bhubneswar.

Started my coding journey at the age of 16 and ever since I believe anything that can be dreamt can be built with code. 
I can code in Python, C and Swift, but JavaScript is my go to language.

You can find my projects <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/harshvarddhantiwari">Github</a>or:wink: my most of the time goes in scrolling , <a target="_blank" href="twitter.com/imharshhub">twitter</a>.


The best way to connect with me is<a href="mailto:harshk915@gmail.com">email</a>.
