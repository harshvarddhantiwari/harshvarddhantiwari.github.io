Hi, :wave: <br><br>
Hi, this is harsh, working as an Associate at Zomato. I have done my Master's in Computer Applications from KIIT University, Bhubaneswar.

I started my coding journey at the age of 16 and ever since I believe anything that can be dreamt of can be built with code.
I can code in Python, C, and Swift, but JavaScript is my go-to language.

You can find my projects on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/harshvarddhantiwari">Github</a> or :wink: most of my time goes in scrolling, <a target="_blank" href="twitter.com/imharshhub">Twitter</a>.

The best way to connect with me is <a href="mailto:harshk915@gmail.com">email</a>.

``` javascript
console.log("Thanks for landing on my page!");
```
